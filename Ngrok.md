# Ngrok

Python can be helpful with web applications also. In this repo you can find some parts of my work with Flask.


I used the NGrok, Because I used a FTP server and it was an easy way to forward localhost.

too install Ngrok visit -> https://ngrok.com/download

In python code 
>>> run_with_ngrok(app)
will call the ngrok
